# Java Training Program
Java: Working with Lambdas, Streams, and Spring Framework
Project developed during the first course of the “Advancing with Java” program by Alura.

🔨 Project Objectives
This project, ScreenMatch, was built from scratch using modern Java practices and Spring Framework tools to simulate a real-world application workflow. Key goals include:

✅ Develop a Java application from the command line using Spring Framework from the start

✅ Manage dependencies efficiently with Maven

✅ Deserialize data using Jackson

✅ Design the application's structure using records, classes, attributes, and methods

✅ Integrate with an external API to retrieve data on TV series, seasons, and episodes

✅ Work extensively with collections and master the use of lambda expressions

✅ Apply Java Streams API to perform operations such as filter, map, sorted, flatMap, peek, and more

✅ Convert streams into custom lists and maps

✅ Generate dynamic and customized statistics from application data

🚀 Technologies Used
Java 17

Spring Framework

Maven

Jackson

RESTful API Consumption

Streams & Lambdas

This project demonstrates not only proficiency with core Java and Spring, but also the ability to build structured, maintainable, and scalable code—skills essential for modern backend development.
